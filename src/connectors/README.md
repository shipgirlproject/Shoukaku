## Shoukaku's Supported Libraries

> [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/#/) (v13.x.x)

```js
const { Shoukaku, Libraries } = require('shoukaku');
new Shoukaku(new Libraries.DiscordJS(client), servers, options);
```

> [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris/) (0.15.x / 0.15.x-dev)

```js
const { Shoukaku, Libraries } = require('shoukaku');
new Shoukaku(new Libraries.Eris(client), servers, options)
```

> Implement your own 

## Implementing your own

> Refer to `DiscordJS.js` inside the `wrappers` folder for my original implementation of the library plugins

> Then require the js file on `Libraries.js`

> Then call it by calling `Libraries.WrapperName(InitializedClient)` on your Shoukaku require

Example
```js
const { Shoukaku, Libraries } = require('shoukaku');
// example if you made it for eris, then you required it on Libraries.JS with it's key being Eris
new Shoukaku(new Libraries.Eris(client), servers, options);
// where in the client is your eris client
```

> And Submit a PR so other people don't need to do it themselves, yay!

> This enables Shoukaku to be used on another library without the hassle of doing so
